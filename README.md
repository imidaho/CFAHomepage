# CFAHomepage

This is my attempt at a redesign of my current employer's home page.  In the long run, I'd like to add a few additional items such as a popup video player, making the javascript enabled form fade in and hover over the page, and drop down menus that appear with the hover psuedo class in the nav bar.  I have to crawl before I can run though!!

So, I have created page with a responsive navbar, hero image, and main logo.  the hero image and main logo resize without a media query, and the navbar triggers at 850 pixels.  

Please use Chrome to view page


Click on "What's your farm issue?" to reveal a form.
Javascript functions were used to open and close the form.


Thanks for the opportunity!
